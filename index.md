Hi, I'm Katelyn! I'm a sophomore at Cornell University in the College of Engineering, majoring in Mechanical Engineering and minoring in Business. On campus, I'm involved in Cornell Data Science, Cornell Figure Skating Club, Women in Computing Committee at Cornell, and Society of Women Engineers. Some relevant classes I'm taking are Statics and Mechanics of Solids, Thermodynamics, and Differential Equations for Engineers. I am passionate about blending technical problem-solving with creative design and business strategy. On this site, you can explore my projects, coursework, and CV.
